# go-micro-framework
A template for setting up Go Micro-services written in Golang, with a simple example which uses Kafka, believe it or not, acting as a server for the microservice.

## Why ?
This is a result of working exclusively in Golang to setup microservices at my current workplace.

This is only an attempt to capture what I have learnt from my experience writing the microservice in a different way every month, only to learn that they all do and need exactly the same dependencies.

This was an effort on my part to make the implementation of microservices written in Go easier for my peers at my workplace and also for me to try my hands at creating a new framework.

I have been inspired by all the work done in Gizmo, go-micro and go-kit, and would love to get some feedback on what I did right and/or wrong implementing the framework.
